# My Portfolio

Hi! 👋 I'm Tobias and this is my personal portfolio built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## About Me
 My journey into frontend development started because I love combining creativity with technology, building user-friendly and visually appealing web experiences.

## Technologies I Use
- **React** – for dynamic and interactive components  
- **TypeScript** – for type safety and better code quality  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for fast and responsive design  

## My Portfolio
In my portfolio, I aim to showcase not only my technical projects but also my deep passion for **music**. Music has always been a major part of my life, and I highlight it through design and functionality in my projects, such as audio and video players directly on the site.

## Projects & Features
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile  
- Interactive UI built with React components  
- Integrated audio and video players (hosted via Cloudinary)  
- Focus on user experience and visual details
